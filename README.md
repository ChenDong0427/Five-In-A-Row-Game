# Five-In-A-Row-Game
This is a five in a row game created by Chen Dong from Boston University

# Idea
This idea originated from CS111 course which the assignment nine asked me to form a different version of AI game. It is very similar to five in a row but with less freedom of where the checker should be palced. The assginment nine codes are also available in the folder. 

# What is five in a row?

Two players usually use black and white chess pieces, which are played in turn at the intersection of the straight and horizontal lines of the board, first on the horizontal, straight or diagonal lines.
